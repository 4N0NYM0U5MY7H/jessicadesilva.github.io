            <p>If you signed up fro two MWF classes back-to-back, you have approximately ten minutes to travel from one
                course location to the next. This time constraint induces student traffic across campus and can result
                in consistent tardiness. We collected data to approximate the typical walking speed of a Stan State
                student and used this to produce the average time it will take to walk between pairs of buildings on
                campus. Our data suggests that you may be late for you next class if you are a slow walker or if walking
                paths are congested.</p>

            <p>Gerrymandering is the term used to describe the drawing of legislative districts to favor one party over
                another. Recently, many mathematicians have tried to develop mathematical tools to decide if legislative
                districts are gerrymandered, and define fair methods of districting. For example, Landau, Reid, and
                Yershov [A Fair Division Solution to the Problem of Redistricting, Social Choice and Welfare, 2008]
                propose a protocol for districting based on a two-player fair-division process, where each player is
                entitled to draw the districts for a portion of the state. We call this the LRY protocol.</p>

            <p>The Ramsey multiplicity constant of a graph <i>H</i> is the minimum proportion of copies of <i>H</i> in
                the complete graph which are monochromatic under an edge-coloring of the complete graph on <i>n</i>
                vertices as <i>n</i> goes to infinity. A graph <i>H</i> is called <i>r</i>-anti-common if the maximum
                proportion of rainbow copies of <i>H</i> in any <i>r</i>-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on
                <i>n</i> vertices is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring. We disproved the conjecture
                that all bipartite graphs are anti-common.

            <h3>Mean-Shift Clustering in C++</h3>
            <h4>Students: Andrew & Jasmin<br>Majors: Computer Science & Mathematics</h4>
            <p>In the VFP image segmentation algorithm, we applied the k-means clustering algorithm to create the
                hypergraph model for the image. In other hypergraph-based segmentation algorithms, mean-shift clustering
                also produced great results. However, we did not find a suitable C++ implementation of the mean-shift
                algorithm. Andrew and Jasmin worked together to understand the Python implementation of the mean-shift
                algorithm and bandwidth approximation in order to reproduce it in C++. We hope to then be able to
                incorporate this in the image segmentation algorithm and compare results to that of the k-means version.

                    alt="(opens in new tab)">Pokemon GO!</a>. In this project, we were interested
                in analyzing PVP battles in which you choose three of your Pokemon to fight three of your opponent's
                Pokemon. You can swap between any of your three Pokemon throughout the battle and can shield against
                charge attacks exactly twice. The player wins if they defeat all their opponent's Pokemon, or if the
                match time ends and they have the most Pokemon/health remaining.</p>

            <h4>Student: Jesselynn<br>Major: Mathematics</h4>
            <p>In this collaboration, I have had so much fun learning about cellular biology from Jesselynn. Jesselynn
                was a Lab Assistant in Dr. Stephanie Woo's lab at UC Merced while being a full-time math major at Stan
                State. In the Woo Lab, Jesselynn captures videos of zebrafish embryo cells migrating to uniformly spread
                out before coming together to form an endodermal sheet. We are using Fiji/ImageJ to obtain data from
                these videos which we will then analyze in Python to better understand cell migration. Jesselynn will be
                starting the Quantitative Systems Biology PhD Program at UC Merced in Fall 2022.</p>

            <h3>Predictive Modeling of Track Performances</h3>
            <h4>Student: Rommell<br>Major: Physics</h4>
            <p>Rommell has a passion for running track, he was an all-star athlete in high school and even competed on
                Stan State's track team. Using data from <a href="athletic.net" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener external" alt="(opens in new tab)">Athletic.net</a>, we analyzed how an
                athlete's 800 meter time is related to their gender, grade level, and season records for the 400 meter
                and/or 1600 meter. It is often believed that there are strong correlations between these events, the
                best 400m runners often do very well in the 800m and similarly for the 1600m. Although Rommell has since
                graduated with his Physics & Astronomy undergraduate degree from Stan State, he is continuing to work on
                this project while working in a Physics Lab at UC Santa Barbara.</p>
