													Each Fall Alliance Scholars, together with their Alliance Mentors, are invited to the Field of Dreams Conference. The Field of Dreams Conference introduces potential graduate students to graduate programs in the mathematical sciences at Alliance schools as well as professional opportunities in these fields. Scholars spend time with faculty mentors from the Alliance schools, get advice on graduate school applications, and attend seminars on graduate school preparation and expectations as well as career seminars.</td>

												<br>The main goals of the workshop is two-fold: (1) to provide prospective Principal Investigators who have just received their first award or who are considering applying for funding from the MPS programs with valuable information and advice on the policies, procedures, and opportunities available at NSF, (2) to train a pool of future reviewers and encourage volunteering to review as a way to learn about NSF process.  In addition to informational presentations on various topics relevant to the future PI’s, all participants will go through full mock panel review processes in breakout sessions. </td>

													This online conference is the first event of the American Mathematical Society’s paraDIGMS initiative to build a community of practice for graduate education in mathematics, with the goal of making the profession stronger and more equitable. I will be serving on a panel discussing mentoring strategies for undergraduates at HSIs who wish to attend graduate school.</td>

												I am one of the co-organizers for the BAD Math Day conference. BAD Math Days are one-day meetings aimed at facilitating communication between researchers and graduate students of discrete mathematics around the San Francisco Bay Area. These days happen twice a year and strive to create an informal atmosphere to talk about discrete mathematics. The term discrete mathematics is chosen to include at least the following topics: Algebraic and Enumerative Combinatorics, Discrete Geometry, Graph Theory, Coding and Design Theory, Combinatorial Aspects of Computational Algebra and Geometry, Combinatorial Optimization, Probabilistic Combinatorics, Combinatorial Aspects of Statistics, and Combinatorics in Mathematical Physics.</td>

The Women in Combinatorics network, WinCom, is intended as a platform for any Combinatorialist who identifies as a woman and would like to connect with other women for various professional reasons and concerns. A database spreadsheet is available for the public to view as a place to search for women collaborators, keynotes, and mentors to encourage the diversification of our research networks.</td>
