                        meetings aimed at facilitating communication between researchers and graduate students of
                        discrete mathematics around the San Francisco Bay Area. These days happen twice a year and
                        strive to create an informal atmosphere to talk about discrete mathematics. The term discrete
                        mathematics is chosen to include at least the following topics: Algebraic and Enumerative
                        Combinatorics, Discrete Geometry, Graph Theory, Coding and Design Theory, Combinatorial Aspects
                        of Computational Algebra and Geometry, Combinatorial Optimization, Probabilistic Combinatorics,
                        Combinatorial Aspects of Statistics, and Combinatorics in Mathematical Physics.</td>

                        MPS programs with valuable information and advice on the policies, procedures, and opportunities
                        available at NSF, (2) to train a pool of future reviewers and encourage volunteering to review
                        as a way to learn about NSF process. In addition to informational presentations on various
                        topics relevant to the future PI’s, all participants will go through full mock panel review
                        processes in breakout sessions.

                        During Summer 2020, I participated in the Visitng Faculty Program (virtually) at Lawrence
                        Berkeley National Laboratory. In that program, I worked with two of my students, Darcy and Juan,
                        and LBNL scientist Talita Perciano on an image segmentation research project.</td>
