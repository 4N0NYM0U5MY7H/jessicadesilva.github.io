<p>During the summer of 2020, we had the opportunity to participate in the <a href="https://science.osti.gov/wdts/vfp">Visiting Faculty Program (VFP) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a>. During this 10 week program, we worked under <a href="https://tperciano.wixsite.com/home">Talita Perciano</a> from the Data Analytics and Visualization research group at LBNL. I met Talita when I participated in the <a href="http://shinstitute.org/srp-application/">Sustainable Research Pathways Workshop</a>. Although a virtual summer research program wasn't ideal, we still had a lot of fun learning about graph theory, image segmentation, and how to code in C++.</p>

<p>Abstract: X-ray micro-tomography (&mu;-CT) is a non-destructive 3D imaging technique often used to image material samples. The Advanced Light Source at Berkeley National Laboratory houses a synchroton-based &mu;-CT instrument which produces high volumes of data at a fast rate. This has led to the need for image processing techniques capable of extracting valuable information in large complex data sets. Image segmentation is an important processing step which separates various components in an image. Graph-based segmentation algorithms have been used for many years, with current interest primarily in designing algorithms which can handle large data sets. Recent approaches using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) exploit local properties of MRFs to run computations in parallel. In this project, we developed an image segmentation algorithm using a hypergraph-based MRF model. The algorithm is coded in C++ and preliminary results indicate that this generalized model improves precision of the segmentation of &mu;-CT images. We still have a lot left to do, but we are excited about the results so far!</p>
