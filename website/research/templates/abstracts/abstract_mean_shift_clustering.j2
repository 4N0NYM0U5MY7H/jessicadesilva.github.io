<h2 class='h3'>Mean-Shift Clustering in C++</h2>
<h3 class='h4'>Student: Andrew &amp; Jasmin</h3>
<h4 class='h5'>Major: Computer Science &amp; Mathematics</h4>
<p>In the VFP image segmentation algorithm, we applied the k-means clustering algorithm to create the hypergraph model for the image. In other hypergraph-based segmentation algorithms, mean-shift clustering also produced great results. However, we did not find a suitable C++ implementation of the mean-shift algorithm. Andrew and Jasmin are working together to understand the Python implementation of the mean-shift algorithm and bandwidth approximation in order to reproduce it in C++. We hope to then be able to incorporate this in the image segmentation algorithm and compare results to that of the k-means version.</p>
