    <h3>Mean-Shift Clustering in C++</h3>
    <h4>Students: Andrew & Jasmin<br />Majors: Computer Science & Mathematics</h4>
    <p>In the VFP image segmentation algorithm, we applied the k-means clustering algorithm to create the
        hypergraph model for the image. In other hypergraph-based segmentation algorithms, mean-shift clustering
        also produced great results. However, we did not find a suitable C++ implementation of the mean-shift
        algorithm. Andrew and Jasmin worked together to understand the Python implementation of the mean-shift
        algorithm and bandwidth approximation in order to reproduce it in C++. We hope to then be able to
        incorporate this in the image segmentation algorithm and compare results to that of the k-means version.
