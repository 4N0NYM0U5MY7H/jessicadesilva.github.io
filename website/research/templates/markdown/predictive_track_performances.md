Physics

## Description

Rommell has a passion for running track, he was an all-star athlete in high school and even competed on Stan State's track team. Using [data from Athletic.net](athletic.net), we analyzed how an athlete's 800 meter time is related to their gender, grade level, and season records for the 400 meter and/or 1600 meter. It is often believed that there are strong correlations between these events, the best 400m runners often do very well in the 800m and similarly for the 1600m. Although Rommell has since graduated with his Physics & Astronomy undergraduate degree from Stan State, he is continuing to work on this project while working in a Physics Lab at UC Santa Barbara.

Rommell was in the Cal-Bridge program for undergraduates studying astronomy and/or physics.
