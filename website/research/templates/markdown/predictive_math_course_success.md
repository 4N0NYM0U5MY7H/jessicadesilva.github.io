## Title

Predictive Modeling of Mathematics Course Enrollment and Success

## Student

Aaron &amp; Shirley

## Major

Mathematics

## Description

We worked with [Stan State's Institutional Effectiveness and Analytics (IEA)](https://www.csustan.edu/iea) team to study recent trends in our mathematics major courses. In recent semesters, the Mathematics Department has needed to offer more sections of lower and upper divison mathematics courses. This project applied statistical methods to analyze opportunity gaps in certain math major classes disagregated by gender, first-generation status, and underrepresented minority groups.

Aaron &amp; Shirley were both supported as a PUMP Undergraduate Research Group (URG) and through the [Stan State RISE program](https://www.csustan.edu/STEM-success/research-and-immersion-stem-excellence).
