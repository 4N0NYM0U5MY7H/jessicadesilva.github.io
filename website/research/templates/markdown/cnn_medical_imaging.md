## Description

A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm commonly applied to analyze images. This project will determine parameter estimates for a variety of CNN algorithms and compare their accuracy on medical images of skin cancer.

This project is part of the [Stan State Honors program](https://www.csustan.edu/honors).
