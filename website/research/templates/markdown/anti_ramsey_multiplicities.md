## Description

The Ramsey multiplicity constant of a graph *H* is the minimum proportion of copies of *H* in the complete graph which are monochromatic under an edge-coloring of the complete graph on *n* vertices as *n* goes to infinity. A graph *H* is called *r*-anti-common if the maximum proportion of rainbow copies of *H* in any *r*-coloring of the edges of the complete graph on *n* vertices is asymptotically achieved by taking a random coloring. We disproved the conjecture that all bipartite graphs are anti-common.
