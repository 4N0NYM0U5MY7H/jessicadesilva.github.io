## Description

In the VFP image segmentation algorithm, we applied the k-means clustering algorithm to create the hypergraph model for the image. In other hypergraph-based segmentation algorithms, mean-shift clustering also produced great results. However, we did not find a suitable C++ implementation of the mean-shift algorithm. Andrew and Jasmin worked together to understand the Python implementation of the mean-shift algorithm and bandwidth approximation in order to reproduce it in C++. We hope to then be able to incorporate this in the image segmentation algorithm and compare results to that of the k-means version.
