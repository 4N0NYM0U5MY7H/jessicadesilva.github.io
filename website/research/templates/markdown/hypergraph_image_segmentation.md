## Description

During the summer of 2020, we had the opportunity to participate in the [Visiting Faculty Program (VFP)](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/vfp) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During this 10 week program, we worked under [Talita Perciano](https://tperciano.wixsite.com/home) from the Data Analytics and Visualization research group at LBNL. I met Talita when I participated in the [Sustainable Research Pathways Workshop](http://shinstitute.org/srp-application/). Although a virtual summer research program wasn't ideal, we still had a lot of fun learning about graph theory, image segmentation, and how to code in C++.

The following semester, both Darcy and Juan were supported by the [Stan State SERSCA program](https://www.csustan.edu/office-research-sponsored-programs/sersca-program).
