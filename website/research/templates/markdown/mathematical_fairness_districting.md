## Description

Gerrymandering is the term used to describe the drawing of legislative districts to favor one party over another. Recently, many mathematicians have tried to develop mathematical tools to decide if legislative districts are gerrymandered, and define fair methods of districting. For example, Landau, Reid, and Yershov [A Fair Division Solution to the Problem of Redistricting, Social Choice and Welfare, 2008] propose a protocol for districting based on a two-player fair-division process, where each player is entitled to draw the districts for a portion of the state. We call this the LRY protocol.

This research was done at the [Carnegie Mellon University Summer Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute (SUAMI)](https://www.cmu.edu/math/undergrad/suami/home/index.html).
